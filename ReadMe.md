Volume Segmantics is a PyTorch Deep-learning Segmentation Toolkit providing a simple command-line interface and API that allows researchers to quickly train a variety of 2D PyTorch segmentation models (e.g.  U-Net, U-Net++, FPN, DeepLabV3+) on their 3D datasets. These models use pre-trained encoders, enabling fast training solutions on a range of biological datasets where it has been optimised for minimal data input; a single dataset in between 128 and 512 cubic pixels, is able to produce efficient and accurate predictions on much larger comparable images. Great success has been seen even using small computing power, however with increased capability, and using the toolkits advanced functionality, larger and more complex datasets can now be processed with a reduced timeframe.

Given a 3D image volume and corresponding dense labels (the segmentation), a 2D prediction model is trained on image slices taken along the x, y, and z axes, where image augmentations are used to expand the size of the training datasets. Subsequently, the library enable using these trained models to segment larger 3D datasets, automatically merging predictions made in orthogonal planes and rotations to reduce artifacts that may result from predicting 3D segmentation using a 2D network.

This work utilises the abilities afforded by the excellent [segmentation-models-pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch) library in combination with augmentations made available via [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/) and from the [MONAI](https://github.com/project-monai/monai) library. Also the metrics and loss functions used make use of the hard work done by Adrian Wolny in his [pytorch-3dunet](https://github.com/wolny/pytorch-3dunet) repository. 

## Requirements

A machine capable of running CUDA enabled with a recent version of Pytorch (2.5 or greater is recommended); this generally means a reasonably modern NVIDIA GPU. The exact requirements differ according to operating system. For example, on Windows you will need Visual Studio Build Tools as well as CUDA Toolkit installed; see [the CUDA docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) for more details. 

## Installation

### Conda/Virtual_env (PyPI)

The latest published release may be installed from the Python Package Index in a new conda environment or virtual_env with python (ideally >= version 3.10) and pip. For more information, documentation for [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) can be found at these sites respectively. Simply activate your new environment and install; 

```shell
pip install volume-segmantics
```

If you find a CUDA-enabled build of PyTorch is not being installed by pip (this particularity seems to be an issue on Windows), you can try this adaption;

```shell
pip install volume-segmantics --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl
```

> Further information regarding VolSeg installation can be found in the [Installation Documentation](TBC)

### Docker/Apptainer Container (quay.io)
A container image with the latest published release is available on the Rosalind Franklin's quay.io instance. You can pull and run this using Apptainer:

```shell
apptainer run --nv docker://quay.io/rosalindfranklininstitute/volume-segmantics
```
Or Docker:

```shell
docker run \
    --gpus all \
    --ipc=host \
    -v /path/to/data:/data
    quay.io/rosalindfranklininstitute/volume-segmantics
```

Note `--ipc=host` grants the container access to host shared memory, since the default allocation in Docker (64M) may be insufficient. More details can be found on the [Volume EM Container documentation](https://rosalindfranklininstitute.github.io/volume-em-container-documentation/software/volume-segmantics/).


## Configuration and Command line use

After installation, two new commands will be available from your terminal whilst your environment is activated; `model-train-2d` and `model-predict-2d`.

These commands require access to YAML files settings stored in the VolSeg install. These need to be located in a directory named `volseg-settings` within the directory where you are running the commands. The Default settings files can be copied from [here](https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/volume-segmantics/blob/main/volseg-settings) if changes to them are made and you need a fresh start. 

> The file `2d_model_train_settings.yaml` can be edited in order to change training parameters such as image size, model architecture, learning rate, loss functions, evaluation metrics and also more advanced training settings. 

> The file `2d_model_predict_settings.yaml` can be edited to change mirrored training parameters (that must remain consistent) and the prediction "quality" e.g "low", "medium" and "high" quality.

Further information reguarding the **Default and more specific Settings** can be found detailed in the [Settings Guide](https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/volume-segmantics/tree/vs04b4/docs/Docs_Settings-Guide) documentation. 

Check the normalisation settings carefully for your intended use; different datasets may require different choices from the default; double-check that the prediction normalisation settings match those used for training.

### For training a 2D model on a 3D image volume and corresponding label

Run the following command. Input files can be in HDF5 or multi-page TIFF format or MRC format. The *--data* and *--labels* arguments define the training image and label files used within the model training, and describe a single image and label match as an **Image-Label Pair**. The relative size of each X-Y-Z measurement does not have to be equal (not a perfect square), however the *Image-Label Pair* must be the same size spatially and comparable in 3 dimensions, fitting into each other without gaps to be successful.

```shell
model-train-2d --data path_to_image_data --labels path_to_segmentation_labels.
```

Paths to multiple Image-Label Pairs can also be added after the `--data` and `--labels` flags respectively; keep in mind these must be chronological per flag. A output model will be trained according to the training settings YAML, saved to your working directory and contain 4 files;

- 1] **.pytorch** model file; the segmentation model created by the train command that can be used to predict on other images,
- 2] **model_loss-Plot.png**; a graph showing the training and validation loss over the course of the training epochs (a *graphical* representation of the model's success),
- 3] **model_prediction_image.png**; showing specific slices of the image and labels used within the model, and the resultant prediction test outcomes for that slice (a *visual* representation model's success),
- and 4] **stats.csv**; a record of the training loss, validation loss and evaluation score per epoch (comparable to a DiceScore (1.0 equals 100% accuracy); accuracy of the test prediction generated versus the original label).

### For 3D segmentation prediction using a 2D model

Run the following command. Input image files can be in HDF5 or multi-page TIFF format or MRC format, though the model file must be in .pytorch format.

```shell
model-predict-2d path_to_model_file path_to_prediction_data
```

The input data will be segmented using the input model following the settings specified in the prediction setting YAML. Depending on your set OUTPUT_FORMAT in *config.py*, set to "tif" or "hdf" or "mrc", a relative label file containing the segmented volume will be saved to your working directory.

### Training features

Volume Segmantics supports training using a variety of U-net encoder-decoder architectures and encoder choices, including transformer-based models such as DINO.  It allows purely axial or tri-planar/multi-axis prediction as well as supporting multiple decoder and multiple head architectures and multi-task training through a configurable `pipeline.yaml`. There are also a variety of loss functions available as per your user case specification and model architecture needs. 

Volume Segmantics supports multiple augmentation libraries and **2.5D slicing**, which creates multi-channel images from adjacent slices in the volume which provides the model with spatial context from adjacent slices; this feature can be enabled by setting `use_2_5d_slicing: True` in the training settings file where the encoder adjusts to use the number of input channels specified by the *num_slices parameter* in training settings YAML (only when 2.5D slicing is enabled). 

Other functions also include Multitask and Self-Supervised Learning options; further information regarding these **specific utilities** and **additional or more advanced training and prediction options** can be found detailed in the [Functionality](https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/volume-segmantics/tree/vs04b4/docs/Docs_Functionality) documentation.

### Tutorial using example data

A **tutorial** using the toolkits default settings, and containing detailed instructions for initial environment setup and settings YAML configuration, is available [here](https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/volume-segmantics/blob/vs04b4/docs/VOlSeg_Tutorial.md); it provides a walk-through of how to segment blood vessels from synchrotron X-ray micro-CT data collected on a sample of human placental tissue.
